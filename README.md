Optimal Adaptive Personalized Drug Injection System.

We propose an optimal adaptive control system for personalized chemotherapeutic drug injection to remove cancerous tumours in the shortest time with minimum chemotherapeutic drug injection. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as machine learning and deep learning, are applied to the thermal images captured from the cancerous organ of the patient to obtain an accurate model for the tumour growth in real-time with considering the effects of tumour cells, normal cells, immune cells, chemotherapy drug agents, and other essential parameters, such as the toxicity of the body, and the resistance of the tumour cells against chemotherapy drug.
